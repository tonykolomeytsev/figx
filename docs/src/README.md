# Introduction

Figmagic is a CLI tool for managing assets exported from Figma. It's an ideal choice for medium to large projects, as it doesn’t require changes to your project structure and is simple to configure.

- ⚡ **Fast**: Figmagic exports and transforms assets from Figma significantly faster than figma-export, and orders of magnitude faster than doing it manually.

- ⚖️ **Correct**: The result of importing assets into your project precisely reflects what’s defined in the Figmagic configuration — no more, no less. You now have a single source of truth for design assets.

- 🛡️ **Reliable**: Importing assets through Figmagic yields the same result on any machine. Non-reproducible results can only occur due to changes made by designers in Figma, not because of the developers or the tool.

- ♻️ **Caching**: Network requests are minimized. Only changed assets are fetched. The cache is portable across machines.
