# Remotes

## Remote
*Similar to a remote in Git*

In the context of FigX, a **remote** refers to a specific file or frame in Figma from which assets are exported. Remotes tell FigX where to fetch the specified resources from.

You can define as many remotes as you need. Different remotes can point to entirely different Figma files, or to different containers, frames, or nodes within the same file.

At least one remote must be marked as default = trueâ€”this tells FigX which source to use if no remote is explicitly specified for a resource.

**Example configuration in `.figtree.toml` (workspace root):**

```toml
[remotes.icons]
default = true
file_key = "LlHCBPLR7yasnxwfsnCapl"
container_node_ids = ["8188-258268", "8188-258269"]
# access_token = ...

[remotes.illustrations]
file_key = "aBcD1234EfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt"
container_node_ids = ["9900-112233"]
# access_token = ...
```

## Access Token Configuration

The `access_token` field can be configured in multiple ways depending on your environment:

### Option 1: Environment Variable
```toml
access_token.env = "FIGMA_PERSONAL_TOKEN"
```

The token will be read from the specified environment variable.

### Option 2: Secure Keychain Storage (macOS and Windows only)
```toml
access_token.keychain = true
```
FigX will retrieve the token from the system's secure credential storage. This method is recommended for local development. To add a token to the keychain, run the command:

```bash
figx auth
```
This will launch a web interface to guide you through authentication.

### Option 3: Priority Lookup
You can specify a list of token sources in priority order. For example:

```toml
access_token = [
  { env = "FIGMA_PERSONAL_TOKEN" },
  { keychain = true },
]
```
In this case, FigX will first try to read the token from the environment variable. If not found, it will fall back to the secure keychain.

This setup is ideal for combining CI environments (which typically use environment variables) with secure storage on local machines.
